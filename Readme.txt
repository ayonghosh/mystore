MYSTORE
===============================================================================

MyStore is a simple app to demonstrate the basic functionality of a shopping 
cart.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Click the MYSTORE logo on the header to go to the product listings page.

Click the cart icon on the header to view/modify the shopping cart.

Click the user icon on the header to login/logout (a session is persisted on
page refresh).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
API
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

POST /api/login {username,password} Log in (the only accepted credentials are 
test/test)

POST /api/logout End the session

GET /api/products Get all products. If a comma-separated product ids is passed
as a query parameter 'pids', then only those product details are returned

GET /api/session Gets the session information (can be used to check if the 
user is currently logged in).

GET /api/addresses Gets the list of the user's saved addresses

POST /api/checkout Creates an order before payment is made. The order id
generated by the back end is passed on to the payment gateway. If the
payment is successful the order id is passed back to the app and is valid,
otherwise the order id gets deleted from the back end.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAYMENT GATEWAY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The route '/pg' is a rudimentary payment gateway. The user can either accept
to successfully complete the payment or cancel the payment (payment failure).

The order id is passed on from the app to the payment gateway. In a practical
scenario the order id would be valid if the payment succeeds, it would be
cleared from the back end otherwise.

After successful payment the cart is reset (cleared).
